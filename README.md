[![mitosis-mjt](http://img.youtube.com/vi/hMlQvZNmCc8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMlQvZNmCc8)

## Summary

This branch adds support of [YJ-14015][yj-ebay] bluetooth modules and IAR.

It also makes use of the keyswitch board LED (it blinks two times on powering up to indicate that firmware works).

I'm using [modified QMK firmware](https://github.com/joric/qmk_firmware/blob/mitosis-joric/keyboards/mitosis/mitosis.c) (with mitosis-MJT keymap) that adds LED startup sequence to the receiver as well.

## Software

Original Mitosis software repository: https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis

* [IAR] - IDE that includes a C/C++ compiler (IAR 7.50.2 for ARM)
* [nRF5 SDK] - nRF51/52 toolchain ([nRF5_SDK_11.0.0_89a8197.zip])
* [OpenOCD] - embedded debugger for Windows 10 ([openocd-0.10.0-dev-00247-g73b676c.7z])
* [WinAVR] - firmware tools for AVR MCU ([WinAVR-20100110-install.exe])
* [Zadig] - you will need to install libusb in order to run OpenOCD ([zadig-2.3.exe])

## Hardware

Original Mitosis hardware repository: https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis-hardware

* [ST-LINK/V2][stlink]: $2.54, had in stock (you can also use [$1.80](https://www.aliexpress.com/item//32583160323.html) STM32 board [instead](https://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/2017/07/BluePill-STM32F103-to-BlackMagic-Probe.html)).
* [YJ-14015][yj-ali]: nrf51822 modules, 3 pcs: $10.5 ($3.50 * 3), free shipping, need 2/3, so $7.
* [10 main PCB's][mitosis.zip] from [EasyEDA], $13.32 ($2 + $11.32 for trackable shipping), used 4/10, so $5.32.
* [3 receiver PCB's][receiver.zip] from [OshPark], $5.40, free shipping, used only 1/3, so $1.80.
* [Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/-/32648920631.html) from Aliexpress (price varies from $2.54 to $4), had in stock.
* [Si2302] mosfets: board survives reverse polarity for a while, you may just [short the pads](https://i.imgur.com/h1Mx8Yw.jpg).
* [ASMB-MTB1-0A3A2] from Aliexpress (or Cree CLVBA-FKA, or 3 single LEDs, very optional)
* [AMS1117]: 5v to 3v regulator, had in stock. You probably can use diodes for 2v drop.
* [1206 4.7k] resistor arrays, 2 pcs: had in stock (taken from an old motherboard).
* Switches and caps: most of you have more than you can handle.

### Total

* Keyboard: $12.32 ($7 + $5.32) and I got enough PCBs to build 3 and they can reuse receiver.
* Receiver: $7.84 ($3.50 + $1.80 + $2.54) firmware upgrade to ble and you wouldn't need it at all.

So, about $20 for a single keyboard.

### PCB Manufacturers

* https://oshpark.com - 3 purple receiver PCBs, $5.40, untracked, 21 days
* http://easyeda.com - 10 green PCBs for $2 + $11.32 shipping = $13.32, trackable, 10 days
* https://www.elecrow.com - 6 black PCBs for $4.90 + $6.42 shipping = $11.32, trackable, 36 days
* http://dirtypcbs.com - 10 black for $16.95 + $9.00 shipping = $25.95, untrackable, lost/refunded
* https://www.seeedstudio.com - 10 black PCBs for $4.90 + $16.50 shipping = $21.40 - untested
* https://jlcpcb.com - 10 black PCBs for $2 + $10.98 shipping = $12.98 - untested

## IAR support

Original build used blue Waveshare Core51822 (B)
modules ([$6.99](http://www.waveshare.com/core51822-b.htm)), but aliexpress has slightly smaller black YJ-14015
modules that are also much cheaper (about $3.50), you can find them on Aliexpress or [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/BLE4-0-Bluetooth-2-4GHz-Wireless-Module-NRF51822-Board-Core51822-B-/282575577879).
It seems like stock firmware that works on Core51822 (B), doesn't work on YJ-14015 at all (update, already works, see https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis/pull/7).
You can build a working firmware in IAR, using provided project (open .eww, run build, that's all).
You may also use precompiled firmware from the `precompiled_iar` folder.

## GCC support

This repository now supports GCC for YJ-14015 as well, so there's no need for IAR.
Use GCC-prebuild firmware from the precompiled folder or apply this diff https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis/pull/7
(update: it's already merged into upstream).


## nRF51 Firmware

This firmware is used for the nRF51 modules on the keyboard halves and the receiver.

### Precompiled nRF51 Firmware

This precompiled firmware features YJ-14015 support and status LEDs support.

* [precompiled-basic-left.hex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joric/mitosis/devel/precompiled_iar/precompiled-basic-left.hex) (left half)
* [precompiled-basic-right.hex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joric/mitosis/devel/precompiled_iar/precompiled-basic-right.hex) (right half)
* [precompiled-basic-receiver.hex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joric/mitosis/devel/precompiled_iar/precompiled-basic-receiver.hex) (receiver)

### Uploading nRF51 Firmware


#### ST-Link V2

To flash nRF modules, connect ST-LINK/V2 to the module programming pins (SWCLK, SWDIO, GND, 3.3V - top to bottom) and run this batch (windows 10):

```
@echo off
set path=C:\SDK\openocd-0.10.0-dev-00247-g73b676c\bin-x64;%path%
set file=%~dp0custom\iar\_build\nrf51822_xxac.hex
openocd -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/nrf51.cfg ^
-c init -c "reset halt" -c "flash write_image erase %file:\=/%" -c reset -c exit

```

#### BluePill

This is basically an [$1.80](https://www.aliexpress.com/item//32583160323.html) STM32 board (STM32F103C8T6) that you can use as an ST-Link V2 replacement.
No OpenOCD needed.
You need to flash the programmer firmware ([Blackmagic](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic)) first.
Most likely you get 64K device (page is not writeable, etc.) so just run STM32 Flash loader GUI,
hook up STM32F103 via UART ([RX - A9, TX - A10](https://i.imgur.com/sLyYM27.jpg)), force select 128K device, 0x08002000, and flash blackmagic.bin from there.
Then unplug UART and hook up nRF51 ([SWCLK - A5, SWDIO - B14](https://i.imgur.com/Ikt8yZz.jpg)).

* https://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/2017/07/BluePill-STM32F103-to-BlackMagic-Probe.html (detailed instructions)
* https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/flasher-stm32.html (STM32 Flash loader)

Note that if you use Bluetooth (e.g. s130) you need to use mergehex utility from the 
[nRF5x Command Line Tools](http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.tools%2Fdita%2Ftools%2Fnrf5x_command_line_tools%2Fnrf5x_installation.html):

```
mergehex.exe -m s130.hex mitosis.hex -o out.hex
```

Then use arm-none-eabi-gdb for uploading (you can find it in the Arduino IDE folders, with the nRF51 board installed):

```
arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe -ex "target extended-remote \\.\COM5" -ex "mon swdp_scan" -ex "att 1" ^
-ex "mon erase_mass" –ex "load out.hex" –ex "quit"

```

Then disconnect the programmer and reconnect power, or run the program from the GDB prompt - "load out.hex", "run".


### Building nRF51 Firmware

I am using Windows 10 and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for everything.

Building nRF firmware with GCC:

```
sudo apt install openocd gcc-arm-none-eabi
(edit nRF5_SDK_11/components/toolchain/gcc/Makefile.posix, set GNU_INSTALL_ROOT := /usr/)
cd nRF5_SDK_11
git clone https://github.com/joric/mitosis && cd mitosis && git checkout devel
cd mitosis-keyboard-basic/custom/armgcc && make

```

## QMK Firmware

This firmware is used for the Arduino Pro Micro on the keyboard receiver.

### Precompiled QMK Firmware

First of all, check [QMK repository](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/mitosis/keymaps) maybe your keymap is already merged.

### Uploading QMK Firmware

To flash prebuilt QMK firmware on Pro Micro, press reset button on the receiver and run the script below.
You can look up the bootloader port in device manager (e.g. COM9), it shows only for a few seconds after reset.

```
set path=C:\WinAVR-20100110\bin;%path%
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P COM9 -c avr109  -U flash:w:mitosis_default.hex
```

### Building QMK firmware:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc
cd qmk_firmware
make mitosis-default
```

## Bluetooth Version

* https://github.com/joric/mitosis/tree/devel/mitosis-bluetooth (work in progress)

### Summary

Mitosis is not a Bluetooth keyboard. It uses a proprietary rf-protocol (Gazell) and a dedicated receiver.
Global layers need two wireless channels - Bluetooth HID and something for the communication between halves.
Possible solutions are listed below.

### Gazell

There are examples of Bluetooth and Gazell running concurrently but no working HID firmware yet.

* https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrf51-ble-gzll-device-uart (no Gazell host supported)
* https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nRF51-multi-role-conn-observer-advertiser (usage of the timeslot API)

### Bluetooth UART service

There are a few split keyboards that successfully run Bluetooth HID and Bluetooth UART service concurrently.
Most of them use Adafruit nRF52 library and simple sketches written and compiled in Arduino IDE.

#### Arduino nRF5

There is [Arduino-nRF5 by Sandeep Mistry] that supports nRF51.
You could use [arduino-BLEPeripheral] library for sketches.
Works fine with BLE400 board ([Arduino IDE setup](https://i.imgur.com/8dfPZFm.jpg), [wiring](https://i.imgur.com/A9QIN2j.jpg)).
Sadly this library has [multiple issues](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-BLEPeripheral/issues/160) with Windows 10.

#### Arduino nRF52

Note that Arduino nRF52 builds (usually based on [Bluefruit nRF52](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406) boards)
are NOT compatible with the Mitosis keyboard (softdevice s132 and all the software is nRF52-only, Mitosis is nRF51-based).

#### BlueMicro

This is a drop-in Pro Micro replacement that is compatible with Arduino nRF52 boards (it's NOT compatible with nRF51).
BlueMicro is open source, official repositories are [BlueMicro_BLE] (firmware) and [NRF52-Board] (hardware).

## Debugging

Neither nRF51822 nor ST-Link V2 have SWO pin for printf
([there is no tracing hardware in the nRF51 series](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/1875/nrf51822---debug-output-via-j-link-swo)),
so I had to use UART. You only need ONE pin to print messages via UART (e.g. using Arduino IDE Serial Monitor).
There are no free broken out pins on the Mitosis so I've used pin 19 (bottom right key) as TX_PIN_NUMBER
and it worked ([see mitosis-bluetooth](https://github.com/joric/mitosis/tree/devel/mitosis-bluetooth)).

## Schematics

There were speculations that Core 51822 has 32 GPIO pins available, so it's possible to make an Atreus62 without
using a keyboard matrix. It is not true. GPIO 26/27 are shared by the 32kHz crystal
and [there are only 31 GPIOs hence PIN31 is not existing](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/5674/pin-31-interrupt). So you could only have 29 keys
on each side (58 total) if you manage to layout them without crossing.
